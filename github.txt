Github
* Github is a distrubuted revision system/source code management system
* Git is initially developed by linus torvalds for linux kernal development
* Github is a free distributed open source
* Github liciensed under GNU General Public Liciense version 2

Version Control System(VCS)
* software that helps developers to work together
* allows to work simultaneously
* it doesn't allow overwriting each other's changes
* it maintains history

two types of version control systems
* Centralised version control system(CVCS)
* Distributed version control system(DVCS)

CVCS
* CVCS uses a central server to store all the files and enables team collobaration
* Drawbacks of CVCS is failure of central server
* if central server goes down for one hour no one can collobarate for one hour
* disk of central server gets corrupted and proper backup then you will lose the entire history of that project

DVCS
* They can fully mirror our repositories
* if server is down  then the repositories from any client can be copied back to server.
* every checkout is a backup of the repository
* you can commit changes
* you can also offline 
* network is required only to publish your requirements
Fast and small - written in c and  perform operations locally
free and open source - free over internet
implicit backup - changes or losing is very rare
security - Git uses a cryptographic function SHA1
no need any powerful hardware
